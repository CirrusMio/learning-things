Put simply, the CirrusMio Way is continuous improvement.

Software does not start out being robust. It gets to a point of success through
many small wins and meaningful tweaks. This is one of the core tenants of agile
development -- constant reassessment and setting attainable goals will drive a
project forward.

Businesses are not immediately successful enterprises. It requires monitoring of
competitors, assessment of market opportunities, and skillful execution to take
off. It typically takes many attempts to enter a market before there is a decent
amount of success. By continuously improving our relationship with customers and
defining our place in the market, we can iterate toward success.

It is important to constantly develop our team as well. We want to improve the
value of each individual while also improving the relationship of the team as a
whole. The best way to achieve this is to offer a path for individual mastery,
and introduce more and varied interactions with your peers.

A novice leverages skills that already exist. An expert can synthesize new
concepts. The pathway has many parallels, from learning to teaching, and from
planning to executing. In the documents below, you will have the tools to
progress toward expertise.

Your success is likely if you maintain:

* passion
* communication
* determination
* curiosity
