## Tutorial list

#### TODO: getting a linux+ruby environment with Vagrant

#### Ruby Koans

[Ruby Koans][koans] are exercises that introduce you to core concepts of the
Ruby language. Through testing, you can manipulate code and ensure you achieve a
correct solution.

[Zen Koans][zenkoans] are the namesake of the project. A Koan is a riddle whose
solution helps a student progress toward enlightenment.

<blockquote>
Ruby Koans are the best way to get involved in writing ruby as you learn the
various concepts. They make a great first introduction for the complete neophyte
and the validation they provide through testing is a great ego-stroke to keep
you learning.
