# Techniques for Learning

## Foundational Phase

During the foundational phase of your technical learning yo will need to study.
This includes books, online tutorials, and reading other pepoles code. Use this
time to meet with people who can help guide you along your path.

### Books

To effectively use books you need to distil information about syntax, flow
control, and the constructs of the language (classes, methods, etc). It is
important to keep a book that functions as a reference that you can turn to as
you read other projects and learn new techniques.

### Tutorials

Tutorials are a great first way to apply programming concepts. They can present
you with challenges and test your understanding. It is important to put yourself
against challenges so you have an opportunity to recall information you've
learned and synthesize new techniques. While a tutorial may send you back to a
reference volume over and over, each time you will come to understand which
concepts are most important in the daily tasks of programming.

### Best Friends

During this time your peer network can be used to recommend books and tutorials
that were meaningful for them as they were learning. Tutorials are written to
guide you through a particular soultion, and the approach thay take can deviate
from best practices. Having friends to
