# Learning, The CirrusMio Way

Put simply, the CirrusMio Way is continuous improvement.

It is important to constantly develop our skills. We want to improve the
value of each individual while also improving the relationship of the team as a
whole. The best way to achieve this is to offer a path for individual mastery,
and introduce more and varied interactions with your peers.

A novice leverages skills that already exist. An expert can synthesize new
concepts. The pathway has many parallels, from learning to teaching, and from
planning to executing. In the documents below, you will have the tools to
progress toward expertise.

Your success is likely if you maintain:

* passion
* communication
* determination
* curiosity

Use the following pages to maintain a list of resources and provide comments and
feedback on them. Each page should list the key takeaways of following the
tutorials, and how we would judge that a student has learned the required
techniques to be qualified at a particular level (beginner, intermediate,
advanced). There is no pathway for the expert level, becuase it is simply
experience and interaction that provide the last mile. There will never be a
course that can compensate for lack of experience.
